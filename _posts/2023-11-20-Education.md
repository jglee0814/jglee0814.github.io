I'm a proud student at Sunkyunkwan University, where I'm currently a sophomore. My primary major is Advanced Materials Science Engineering, and I have a secondary major in the Department of Software. My dedication to my studies has been recognized with scholarships for three consecutive semesters due to my excellent academic performance. Moreover, I am actively involved on campus as a student council member in the Advanced Materials Science Engineering department and have the honor of serving as the president of the photography club.
