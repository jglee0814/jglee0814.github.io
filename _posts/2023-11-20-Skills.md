I have a strong command of the English language, a skill I've developed over the years thanks to my American heritage. I was once bilingual, but as I've spent more time in Korea, my proficiency in Korean has grown significantly. Besides language skills, I have a passion for cooking, and I take pride in creating delicious meals. Additionally, I am an avid photographer, using my Canon camera to capture moments and scenes that inspire me.
